<p><strong>Cap and trade schemes</strong><br />
Cap and trade schemes establish binding controls on the overall amount of emissions from participants. Within this quantity ceiling, participants in the scheme can choose where best to deliver emission reductions by trading units which correspond to quantities of abatement.</p>
<p><strong>Carbon Budget</strong><br />
Allowed emissions volume recommended by the Committee on Climate Change, defining the maximum level of CO2 and other GHG's which the UK can emit over 5 year periods.</p>
<p><strong>Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)</strong><br />
Technology which involves capturing the carbon dioxide emitted from burning fossil fuels, transporting it and storing it in secure spaces such as geological formations, including old oil and gas fields and aquifers under the seabed.</p>

<p><strong>Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emission</strong><br />
The amount of carbon dioxide emission that would give rise to the same level of radiative forcing, integrated over a given time period, as a given amount of well-mixed greenhouse gas emission. For an individual greenhouse gas species, carbon dioxide equivalent is calculated by multiplying the mass emitted by the Global Warming Potential over the given time period for that species. Standard international reporting processes use the time period of 100 years.</p>
<p><strong>Carbon Emissions Reductions Target (CERT )</strong><br />
CERT is an obligation on energy supply companies to implement measures in homes that will reduce emissions (such as insulation, efficient lightbulbs and appliances, etc). (See Supplier obligation).</p>
<p><strong>Carbon leakage</strong><br />
Displacement of carbon dioxide emissions from one counrty to another due to the existence of (stringent) environmental policy(ies) in one country which make(s) it more attractive or viable for high carbon businesses to operate in a country with less stringent regulations.</p>
<p><strong>Carbon Price</strong><br />
Price at which carbon is traded under an emissions trading scheme (see below).</p>
<p><strong>Carbon sink</strong><br />
An absorber of carbon (usually in the form of carbon dioxide). Natural carbon sinks include forests and oceans.</p>
<p><strong>Clean Development Mechanism (CDM )</strong><br />
UN-regulated scheme which allows credits to be issued from projects reducing GHG gases in Kyoto non-Annex 1 countries (developing countries).</p>
<p><strong>Climate</strong><br />
The climate can be described simply as the &lsquo;average weather&rsquo;, typically taken over a period of 30 years. More rigorously, it is the statistical description of variables such as temperature, rainfall, snow cover, or any other property of the climate system.</p>
<p><strong>Climate Change Act</strong><br />
UK law of 26 November 2008.  It makes it the duty of the Secretary of State for Energy &amp; Climate Change to ensure that the net UK carbon account for all six Kyoto greenhouse gases for the year of 2050 is at least 80% lower than the 1990 baseline.</p>
<p><strong>Carbon Change Levy (CCL)</strong><br />
A levy charged on the industrial and commercial supply of electricity, natural gas, coal and coke for lighting, heating and power.</p>
<p><strong>Climate sensitivity</strong><br />
The response of global mean temperatures to increased concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It is typically defined as the temperature increase that would occur at equilibrium after a doubling of carbon dioxide concentration above pre-industrial levels.</p>
<p><strong>Combined Cycle Gas Turbine</strong><br />
A gas turbine generetor that generates electricty. Waste heat is used to make steam to generate additional electricity via a steam turbine, thereby increasing the efficiency of the plant.</p>
<p><strong>Combined Heat and Power (CHP)</strong> The simultaneous generation of heat and power, putting to use heat that would normally be wasted. This results in a highly efficient way to use both fossil and renewable fuels. Technologies range from small units similar to domestic gas boilers, to large scale CCGT or biomass plants which supply heat for major industrial processes.</p>
<p><strong>Company Car Tax</strong><br />
A tax applied where, because of their employment, a car is made available for private use by a director or an employee earning &pound;8,500 a year or more, or to a member of their family or household. This tax is based on the CO2 performance of the car.</p>
<p><strong>CONSAVE</strong><br />
Consave 2050 was an EC Accompanying Measure Project that developed scenarios on aviation and emissions, with a particular focus on 2050.</p>
<p><strong>Contracts for Difference</strong><br />
A contract between a buyer and a seller, stipulating that the seller will pay to the buyer the difference between the current value of an asset and its value at contract time.</p>
<p><strong>Contrail</strong><br />
Condensation trail (ie white line cloud often visible behind aircraft).</p>
<p><a href="#Top">up&uarr;</a></p>
<p><a name="D">D</a></p>
<p><strong>Derated Capacity</strong><br />
Electricity plant capacities expressed in terms of their average plant availability during peak demand (rather than in terms of their maximum potential output).</p>
<p><strong>Discount Rate</strong><br />
The rate at which the valuation of future costs and benfits decline. It reflects a number of factors including a person's preference for consumption now over having to wait, the value of an extra &pound;1 at different income levels (given future incomes are likely to be higher) and the risk of catastrophe which means that future benefits are never enjoyed. For example, the Social Discount Rate (3.5%) suggests future consumption of &pound;1.035 next year is equivalent in value to &pound;1 today. Discount rates in the private sector generally reflect the real cost of raising capital, or the real interest rate at which consumers can borrow.</p>
<p><strong>Display Energy Certificate (DEC)</strong><br />

<p><strong>Energy Unserved</strong><br />
The amount of demand within each year that cannot be met due to insufficient supply.</p>
<p><strong>Emissions factor</strong><br />
Constant measure of carbon intensity used for calculation of emissions from aviation (eg. to calculate emissions from aviation in the knowledge of the number of flights realised, the appropriate emissions factor would be the average CO2 emissions per flight realised).</p>
<p><strong>Emissions Performance Standard</strong><br />
A CO2emissions performance standard that would entail regulation to set a limit on emissions per unit of energy output. This limit could be applied at plant level, or to the average emissions intensity of a power company's output.</p>
<p><strong>Emissions Trading</strong><br />
Approach to pollution control which leverages economic incentives to deliver emissions cuts in an efficient manner by allowing polluters with the ability to cut their emissions more cheaply to 'sell' emissions credits to other polluters with less flexibility.</p>
