<p>This free training package is designed to enhance the skills planning officers need to take positive action on climate change and increase local authority capacity to tackle causes and effects.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>The training is free of charge to relevant local authority officers and qualifies as CPD for&nbsp;</b><b>planning officers.&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Download the flyer '<a href="http://www.yourclimate.org/system/files/yourclimate/CCSF%20Training%20leaflet%20%285911%29.pdf">Comprehensive Planning and Climate Change Training for Planning Officers</a> <span class="print-footnote">[2]</span>' (pdf)</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The training is organised into 10 modules:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Introduction to climate change policy and context.</strong>&nbsp;This module aims to provide planners with a clear understanding of the relevant UK and&nbsp;EU climate change policy context and how the LDF/Local Plan fits within this framework.&nbsp;<em>As a broad contextual module for the whole series, this module will be aimed at all&nbsp;planning policy, development management, conservation, sustainability, monitoring, and<br />
    building control officers.</em></li>
<li><strong>LDF/plan making evidence base and Implementation of the Yorkshire and<br />
    Humber Renewable and Low Carbon Energy Study, 2011.&nbsp;</strong>This module will be designed to help planners use evidence to craft development policies&nbsp;and identify what evidence is required. It will aim to show officers examples of proportionate&nbsp;and cost effective evidence for climate change policies. The module will show officers<br />
    how to use the information in the Yorkshire and Humber Renewable and Low Carbon<br />
    Energy Study to set and implement local renewable energy targets and policies in the<br />
    LDF/Local Plan.&nbsp;<em>This module will be principally aimed at planning policy officers, but will also be&nbsp;beneficial to sustainability officers and development management officers.</em></li>
<li><strong>Development Policy Development and Supplementary Planning Documents<br />
    for Renewable Energy.&nbsp;</strong>This module will be designed to ensure planners are confident they can design clear,&nbsp;specific, and robust advice to secure Renewable Energy through Development Policies&nbsp;and SPD&rsquo;s. Officers will learn from best practice examples of successful and up-to-date&nbsp;policies and documents.<br />
    <em>This module will be principally aimed at planning policy officers, but will also be<br />
    beneficial to development management and sustainability officers.</em></li>
<li><strong>Development Policy Development and Supplementary Planning Documents<br />
    for Construction.&nbsp;</strong>This module will be designed to ensure planners are confident they can design clear,&nbsp;specific, and robust advice to secure appropriate construction for climate change&nbsp;through Development Policies and SPD&rsquo;s. Officers will learn from best practice examples&nbsp;of successful and up-to-date policies and documents. <em>It is anticipated that this module&nbsp;would be principally aimed at planning policy officers, development management and&nbsp;sustainability officers but may also be of interest to building control and conservation&nbsp;officers.</em></li>
<li><strong>Development Policy Development and Supplementary Planning Documents<br />
    for Green Infrastructure.&nbsp;</strong>This module will be designed to ensure planners are confident they can design clear,&nbsp;specific, and robust advice to secure green infrastructure for climate change through&nbsp;Development Policies and SPD&rsquo;s. Officers will learn from best practice examples of&nbsp;successful and up-to-date policies and documents. <em>This module will be principally aimed&nbsp;at planning policy officers, development management, landscape architects and&nbsp;sustainability officers.</em></li>
<li><strong>Achieving climate change mitigation and adaptation in masterplanning.&nbsp;</strong>This module will help to ensure that planners are confident at all stages of the<br />
    masterplanning process in relation to climate change adaptation and mitigation. It will<br />
    focus on the big issues and aims to show planners how they can achieve so much more&nbsp;than just a strategy for use of micro technologies. Regional examples of best practice will&nbsp;inspire and encourage officers for example on what is possible for achieving CHP as a&nbsp;source of renewable energy on development opportunity sites.<br />
    <em>This module will be principally aimed at development management, regeneration,<br />
    design, planning policy and sustainability officers.</em></li>
<li><strong>Achieving climate change mitigation and adaptation in small scale&nbsp;development.&nbsp;</strong>This module will help give planners an understanding of the role that small scale&nbsp;developments can play in achieving renewable energy potential through microgeneration&nbsp;and cumulative carbon impacts and will help to give planners a clear&nbsp;understanding of the principles of sustainable design and retrofitting.<br />
    <em>This module will be principally aimed at development management, design and<br />
    planning policy officers, but will also be beneficial to conservation and sustainability<br />
    officers.</em></li>
<li><strong>Climate Change and viability.&nbsp;</strong>This module will aim to show officers how to challenge and assess financial information&nbsp;in relation to climate change proposals and will demonstrate the cost effectiveness of&nbsp;sustainable design, and renewable and low carbon measures.&nbsp;<em>This module will be principally aimed at development management, regeneration and&nbsp;planning policy officers.</em></li>
<li><strong>Historical Assets and Climate Change.&nbsp;</strong>This module will emphasis to planners how they can strike the balance of contribution to&nbsp;climate change mitigation and fulfilling the requirements of conservation by managing&nbsp;the historic environment.&nbsp;<em>This module will be aimed at conservation design and building control officers but will&nbsp;also be beneficial to sustainability, planning policy and development management&nbsp;officers.</em></li>
<li><strong>Regulation regimes, likely policy changes and implications for planning<br />
    requirements, monitoring and enforcement.&nbsp;</strong>This module will show planners how to implement policy requirements which is often&nbsp;seen as a great difficulty.&nbsp;<em>This module will be aimed at monitoring, building control, and development&nbsp;management officers but would be beneficial to policy, sustainability and conservation officers.</em></li>
