<p>Two energy-efficient housing developments were recently completed in Barnsley, as part of the 'Green Corridor' programme to tackle low demand in former coalfield communities.</p>
<p>South Yorkshire Housing Association (SYHA), in partnership with Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council and with &pound;1.3m investment from the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA), has completed two developments of 32 family homes: 22 at Cross Lane, Royston, and 10 at Bramah Street, Carlton.</p>
<p>The development is part of the Green Corridor programme, an alliance between Barnsley, Doncaster and Wakefield local authorities to tackle issues of low housing demand and market vulnerability in defined towns and villages next to each other. These areas have a coalfield heritage and lie within a green and rural surrounding.</p>
<p>To celebrate the newly completed homes, residents, and staff from the partners, YHA, BMBC, Bramall Construction and Clayfield Construction joined together with local councillors recently to officially open the two new developments.</p>
<p>Local residents and partners celebrate the completion of the new houses at Cross Lane, Royston</p>
<p>The four-bedroom and three-bedroom homes are available for a combination of rental and shared ownership. Each of the 32 new properties has been built to a contemporary design by SYHA Architects, with a combination of cedar cladding, brick and stonework and large picture windows.</p>
<p>The new homes complement other projects that have been funded by Barnsley Council's Green Corridor Team, such as property improvements, the reinstatement of the original coping stones and the construction of pillars using bricks inscribed with the names of donors who contributed to the building of a chapel.</p>
<p>SYHA Architects have designed each of the properties to a high level of sustainability, which means they benefit from a variety of energy efficiency measures. Each home benefits from solar power and most of them also benefit from rainwater-harvesting systems. The energy-efficiency features on the new homes will help to reduce household utility bills for residents.</p>
<p>Martin Powell, SYHA Project Manager, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&quot;<em>Not only do these two developments help to satisfy housing need in Barnsley, they also demonstrates how partnership working can tap into a range of funding streams for the benefit of the local community and  environment.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<em>The Green Corridor programme has improved Barnsley&rsquo;s appearance and reputation without compromising its local industrial heritage. The new SYHA homes are a shining example of what can be achieved when organisations work together in successful partnerships.</em>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tamsin Hart, area manager at the HCA, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<em>Our investment means that there will be new homes for rent ad sale in these villages offering local people the opportunity to stay in their local community in a home they can afford.</em>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Green Corridor alliance began in 2003 and is a partnership between several government bodies, housing associations and the local authorities. In Barnsley, the Green Corridor is an area of land lying to the north-east of Barnsley and includes the communities of Grimethorpe, Shafton, Brierley, Royston and part of Carlton.&nbsp;</p>
