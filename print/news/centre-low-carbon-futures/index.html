<p>The new Yorkshire-based Centre for Low Carbon Futures (CLCF) is harnessing the research power of leading universities both to develop clean technologies and help in the reduction of carbon emissions. </p>
<p>A joint initiative of Yorkshire Forward and the region's universities, the Centre draws on the expertise of the world class researchers in the region as a focal point for understanding and demonstrating how business can evolve and adapt in a low-carbon world.</p>
<p>At the Centre's official launch in the Palace of Westminster, the former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said: &quot;This is a good example of how universities, industry and government can work together to tackle the issues of climate change and move towards a low carbon future. Climate change is an international issue and so working with businesses in the supply chain and showing the real impact of clean technology and energy particularly with clean coal, CCS, renewable and nuclear in the decarbonisation journey is essential.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very pleased to note that the Yorkshire and Humber region is leading this initiative, and it is well positioned to do so given its prime location for the 'energy belt' and the international excellence of Research and Development from Yorkshire Universities working in partnership with the Regional Development Agency - Yorkshire Forward. This initiative is very important and must be supported given the regional, national and international impact it could create&quot;.</p>
<p>By conducting &quot;translational&quot; research into clean technologies, the Centre will be a conduit for the practical application of low carbon technologies, helping both to attract inward investment and enhance business growth and economic output. It will give the business community a clear direction to help them to increase investment, economic outputs and actual jobs in a low carbon world.</p>
<p>Regional development agency Yorkshire Forward has contributed &pound;5.7m to the Centre, which is led by the Universities of Hull, Leeds, Sheffield and York and draws on the strengths of all the region&rsquo;s education institutions. It is developing an innovative way of translating research into business applications, adding value to regional and national economic development and will help in meeting regional targets to reduce Green House Gas emissions.</p>
<p>The Centre will provide the multi-disciplined approach needed to meet the challenges of a low-carbon society. It will use the combined research not only of the natural sciences, but also the social sciences, engineering and policy disciplines. By combining the power of the region's Universities with Yorkshire Forward and business, CLCF is well positioned to translate research for the benefit of business and communities.</p>
<p>Director Jon Price says &quot;The Centre provides assistance to regional and international business with the practical application of new technologies into useable products. Clearly Climate Change is not just about low carbon technologies, it&rsquo;s also about a change in behaviours - the way we live in a low carbon society.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Centre is multi disciplined, drawing on world-class academics in the social sciences, natural sciences, engineering and economics, from four leading universities of Hull, Leeds, Sheffield and York, as well as many other higher education institutions in the region.&quot;</p>
<p>Tom Riordan, Chief Executive of Yorkshire Forward, adds:&quot;The Centre for Low Carbon Futures will put our region at the forefront of low carbon technologies. It will allow Yorkshire and Humber&rsquo;s businesses to address low carbon challenges and access cutting edge solutions which will help them exploit the opportunities arising from climate change. In turn this will help build a competitive, sustainable and carbon efficient regional economy&quot;.</p>
<p>Professor Brian Cantor, Vice-Chancellor of the University of York and Chair of the Centre's Interim Board, says: &quot;The Centre for Low Carbon Futures is an international initiative which will draw on the huge research strengths of experts in leading universities.  The universities of Hull, Leeds, Sheffield and York also have longstanding relationships with global business and industry, and will be drivers not only of the knowledge economy but also the low carbon economy.&quot;</p>
<p>Rosie Winterton, Minister for Yorkshire and The Humber, adds: &quot;This excellent initiative will help us meet the two key challenges facing the country and our Region, those of climate change and developing a sustainable economic future&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Collaboration between Universities and businesses is one of this region&rsquo;s great strengths.  This new Centre will play a key role in helping us to continue to develop knowledge and technology to a world class level and ensure that our region is at the forefront of moves towards a low-carbon future.&quot;</p>
