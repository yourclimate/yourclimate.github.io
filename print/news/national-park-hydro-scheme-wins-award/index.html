<p>A community hydropower scheme in the Yorkshire Dales National Park has won a regional green award. The River Bain hydro project at Bainbridge won the &lsquo;Best Community&rsquo; category in the 2011 Yorkshire and the Humber Microgeneration Awards.</p>
<p>BBC Look North Climate Correspondent Paul Hudson, who hosted a presentation ceremony at Harrogate&rsquo;s Majestic Hotel, said: &ldquo;Although we are in uncertain financial times, the organisations and people who have been nominated for awards at this event truly reflect the increasing standard, capability and capacity of this industry in our region.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not simply because they have installed a piece of technology on their building or in their house. The real revolution that these pioneers represent is to change the way we regard ourselves. No longer are they simply passive consumers of gas and electricity, they have become generators and producers of their own heat and power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bainbridge project aims to generate enough electricity to power 40 houses &ndash; saving 80 tonnes of CO2 per year &ndash; and any profits will go to other work to mitigate the effects of climate change in Raydale.</p>
<p>It received &pound;50,000 from the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority&rsquo;s Sustainable Development Fund, which is managed by the Yorkshire Dales Millennium Trust.</p>
<p>Will Weston, the YDNPA&rsquo;s Member Champion for Climate Change, said: &ldquo;The Authority is incredibly proud to have played a small part in helping to get this project off the ground. What the community has achieved is truly inspiring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another hydro scheme involving the use of water from a small stream falling from a great height at Manor Farm at Halton Gill also received the same amount from the Fund. This farm diversification project will provide an upland farm with an alternative source of long-lasting income with low maintenance and running costs. The projected energy generation will be equivalent to the consumption of 20 to 25 households.</p>
<p>As well as providing funding to support the Halton Gill and Bainbridge projects, the Authority has already helped to get schemes off the ground at Gayle Mill and Yore Mill and assisted the design of a scheme at Linton Falls that will be built this summer.</p>
<p>It has also funded feasibility studies for community projects at Clapham, Ingleton and West Burton, as well as a number of schemes put forward by private landowners.</p>
